# Membership resurrection act

**of the Global PHP Group**

## Preamble

This act defines an optional mechanism available to administrators to grant the
possibility of removing long lasting bans. There is no general right for members
to request membership resurrection for a banned member, only administrators can
grant a membership resurrection.

## Requirements

Membership resurrections can be applied to accounts which got banned for reasons
(insults, general bad behavior, SPAM) that operate with low social risks.
Membership resurrections can not be applied to accounts which were banned for
reasons (terrorism, hacks, political hate-speech) that operate on high social
risks.

A membership resurrection requires at least one warrant for the account. Warrant
acts as a mentor to the person behind the account to observe and control the
rehabilitation process.

A membership resurrection can only be applied after a ban-period of **one week**.

Warrants can only be people who are at least **3 months** in the group.

## Rights of the warrants

Warrants have the right to *give up* and request the termination of the membership
resurrection. The termination of the membership resurrection has no effect to
the warrants and will enforce the initial punishment.

## Rights of administrators

Administrators have the right to stop a membership resurrection when one or more
warrants are identified as fake accounts.

## Duration of the membership resurrection process

The membership resurrection process remains for a period of 8 weeks. After this
week, the warrants are no longer responsible for the behavior of the resurrected
membership.

## Warrant responsibility

Warrants are responsible for any rule violation the resurrected membership may
deal with. Regardless of the violation in detail, the punishment for both
(warrants and resurrected memberships) will be the initially punished.

To clarify that: A rule violation by the resurrected membership will end with
the permanent removal of the warrant's membership and of the resurrected
membership.

There is no place for discussion. Since a lot must went wrong to get banned, a
resurrection of a banned membership must have high costs.
