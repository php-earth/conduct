  description: 'You are, or will be, a member of a PHP group that allows the discussion of web development topics, this includes topics about PHP, embeddable, client-related or service-extending languages (including NodeJS, JavaScript, CSS), XML, XSLT, YAML and others. You should keep in mind that our group is generally a PHP group. A good mix is what we would see and what we would allow, otherwise 14 days long periods of NodeJS-discussions are not part of our goals. This rule may be improved and reduced to a lower set of languages in the future, depending on how the group acts. How to ask technical questions is described in details in this <a href="http://wwphp-fb.github.io/articles/how-to-ask-technical-questions/">article</a>.'
